# Pony Docset

Latest revision: Pony 0.21.3

[Pony](https://www.ponylang.org) is an "object-oriented, actor-model,
capabilities-secure, high-performance programming language". I found the
original [online documentation](https://stdlib.ponylang.org) a bit cumbersome to use,
so I created this docset.

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager for Mac. If you are using Windows or Linux you probably want to have a look at [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org) which is quite similar to Dash.

Generate docset

The docset is generated with an ugly combination of bash, javascript and the original
[Pony documentation](https://stdlib.ponylang.org).

To generate the docset, simply run `make`.
